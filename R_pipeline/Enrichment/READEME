This R script performs robust pathway enrichment analysis for Neuroblastoma differential gene expression results.
It integrates GO, KEGG, and Reactome enrichment, producing publication-quality plots and tables for biological interpretation.

The workflow is fully automated — from reading DEGs to enrichment, visualization, and exporting outputs — and can easily be adapted to other cancer types or datasets.

🚀 Features

Automatic package installation and loading (CRAN + Bioconductor).

GO, KEGG, and Reactome enrichment for up- and downregulated genes.
Robust gene ID mapping (SYMBOL → ENTREZ).
Safe data handling for mixed or missing fields (e.g., GeneRatio, p.adjust).
Publication-quality dotplots and barplots using ggplot2.
Output-ready files for further integration with Cytoscape or reports.

📂 Input Requirements
Excel file containing two sheets:

UP — list of upregulated genes (column: Name)
DOWN — list of downregulated genes (column: Name)

Output Files:
*_GO_enrichment.csv — Gene Ontology enrichment tables
*_KEGG_enrichment.csv — KEGG pathway tables
*_Reactome.csv — Reactome enrichment results
Neuroblastoma__Activated_Suppressed_Dotplot.png — side-by-side Reactome dotplot
Neuroblastoma_GO_Terms_Barplot_Real.png — combined GO BP barplot
