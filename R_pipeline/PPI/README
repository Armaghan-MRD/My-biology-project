# Universal PPI Builder (BioGRID → Cytoscape)

**Author:** Armaghan Moradi  
**Language:** R  
**Purpose:** Build clean protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks from BioGRID and differential gene expression (DEG) data for Cytoscape visualization.

🧠 Features
- Works with any project (e.g., Neuroblastoma, Osteosarcoma, etc.)
- Reads DEGs from Excel (Up/Down-regulated)
- Extracts matching interactions from BioGRID
- Computes centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness)
- Outputs Cytoscape-ready edge and node tables
- Automatically builds “core + first neighbor” subnetworks

 ⚙️ Requirements
Install required R packages:
```r
pkgs <- c("readxl", "dplyr", "stringr", "readr", "data.table", "tibble", "igraph")
for (p in pkgs) if (!requireNamespace(p, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(p)
